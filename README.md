### try **not** to get used to the "normal" and "common" environment
### focus on the big problems and ambicious goals instead of low-hanging-fruits and easy-short-deliverables
### don't let the **unknowns** gone, it means something no one knows and your matter subject in future
* it's a hard problem, trust your teammates; so,
* it's normally means you are lack of metrics/data, or no dedicated analysis yet
* at this stage, focus on the more monitorings and analyzer tools that could generate more data
### analysises, assumptions and validations
* swim in the ocean is difficult, any assumption should depends on data and knowledge
* every exploration with assumption need validation to ensure the "right" direction
### don't just believe in key-opinion-leader easily in unknown areas
* if they know, it's a known issue

  * impact
  * concurrency
  * latency
### what do they need?
