### interviewer not only evaulate on the technical strength but also look for scope and leadership, especially in mid-senior level.
### being a fierce nerd: http://www.paulgraham.com/fn.html
>There's also a natural connection between nerdiness and independent-mindedness. It's hard to be independent-minded without being somewhat socially awkward, because conventional beliefs are so often mistaken, or at least arbitrary. No one who was both independent-minded and ambitious would want to waste the effort it takes to fit in. And the independent-mindedness of the fierce nerds will obviously be of the aggressive rather than the passive type: they'll be annoyed by rules, rather than dreamily unaware of them.
### jeff@'s last letter to stakeholder: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders
>Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

>In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

### try **not** to get used to the "normal" and "common" environment
### focus on the big problems and ambicious goals instead of low-hanging-fruits and easy-short-deliverables
### don't let the **unknowns** gone, it means something no one knows and your matter subject in future
* it's a hard problem, trust your teammates; so,
* it's normally means you are lack of metrics/data, or no dedicated analysis yet
* at this stage, focus on the more monitorings and analyzer tools that could generate more data
### analysises, assumptions and validations
* swim in the ocean is difficult, any assumption should depends on data and knowledge
* every exploration with assumption need validation to ensure the "right" direction
### don't just believe in key-opinion-leader easily in unknown areas
* if they know, it's a known issue

## Feb/2021, US
### Communicate early and check regularly
### Talk with manager and trusted people on scope
### Why Change
* New option offers more opportunities or not
* Switch team will slow down 1-2 quaters
### Skills
* Skill that could transferable and long-term valuable investment skill
* Find your end goal and have strategy to arrive it

### what do they ask?
* how long has you been at this level?
* what's the team size?
* what's your responsibility in the team?
* what's the complexity of the project?
  * impact
  * concurrency
  * latency
### what do they need?
* improve engineering productivity or efficiency
  * engineering practice
  * engineering culture
### Notes
* it looks to me the actual technology/domain knowledge is not desired, what they need is more on the engineering mechanism/practice/culture.
