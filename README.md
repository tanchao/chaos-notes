### what do they ask?
* how long has you been at this level?
* what's the team size?
* what's your responsibility in the team?
* what's the complexity of the project?
  * impact
  * concurrency
  * latency
### what do they need?
* improve engineering productivity or efficiency
  * engineering practice
  * engineering culture
### Notes
* it looks to me the actual technology/domain knowledge is not desired, what they need is more on the engineering mechanism/practice/culture.
